Working on solving simple and complicated problems while bored

I enjoy solving problems whenever I get a chance to. 
Did a bit of JavaScript practice as a refresher and I solved algorithms that I found on the internet.
I didn't focus on best practices. I mainly got a problem and typed what my brain thought at that moment.
